            <h3>Norway: A Dream Carved in Nature and Light</h3>
            <p>
              Norway, sculpted by time and ice, stretches like a whispered
              legend along the edge of the world. Its fjords carve deep into
              ancient mountains, where waterfalls tumble like silver threads.
              The skies shimmer with northern lights, painting nights in emerald
              and violet, while forests murmur stories older than memory. Every
              breath of its crisp air feels like a hymn, every still lake a
              mirror of the soul.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the hush of Arctic mornings and the golden glow of the midnight
              sun, Norway becomes more than a place—it becomes a dream made
              real. Snowy villages sleep beneath soft silence, and rugged
              coastlines echo the song of the sea. Here, nature rules with quiet
              majesty, inviting you not to conquer, but to listen, to wander,
              and to remember what it means to be truly alive.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Mariya and Norway is my dream destination, a land
              of stunning fjords, the northern lights, and breathtaking nature.
              I truly want to visit it and experience the peace and charm I’ve
              heard so much about.
